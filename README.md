Problem-solving strategies are steps to overcoming the obstacles to achieving a goal, the "problem-solving cycle".

Common steps in this cycle include recognizing the problem, defining it, developing a strategy to fix it, organizing knowledge and resources available, monitoring progress, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution. Once a solution is achieved, another problem usually arises, and the cycle starts again.

Insight is the sudden  [a_ha!_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aha!_moment "Aha! moment")  solution to a problem, the birth of a new idea to simplify a complex situation. Solutions found through insight are often more incisive than those from step-by-step analysis. A quick solution process requires insight to select productive moves at different stages of the problem-solving cycle. Unlike Newell and Simon's formal definition of a  _move problem_, there is no consensus definition of an  _insight problem_.

Some problem-solving strategies include

- Abstraction
- Analogy
- Brainstorming
- Critical thinking
- Divide and conquer
- Lateral thinking
- Means-ends analysis
- Proof of impossiblity
- Reduction
- Research
- Trial-and-error
